      "In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal think",

      "WARNINGS Although failure of patients to show clinical improvement may reflect underdosage, it can also be indicative of overdosage",
      "As is true of all cholinergic drugs, overdosage of pyridostigmine bromide may result in cholinergic crisis, a state characterized by increasing muscle weakness which, through involvement of the muscles of respiration, may lead to death",
      "Myasthenic crisis due to an increase in the severity of the disease is also accompanied by extreme muscle weakness, and thus may be difficult to distinguish from cholinergic crisis on a symptomatic basis",
      "Such differentiation is extremely important, since increases in doses of pyridostigmine bromide or other drugs of this class in the presence of cholinergic crisis or of a refractory or \"insensitive\" state could have grave consequences",
      "Osserman and Genkins 1 indicate that the differential diagnosis of the two types of crisis may require the use of Tensilon TM (edrophonium chloride) as well as clinical judgment",
      "The treatment of the two conditions obviously differs radically",
      "Whereas the presence of myasthenic crisis suggests the need for more intensive anticholinesterase therapy, the diagnosis of cholinergic crisis, according to Osserman and Genkins 1 calls for the prompt withdrawal of all drugs of this type",
      "The immediate use of atropine in cholinergic crisis is also recommended",
      "Atropine may also be used to abolish or obtund gastrointestinal side effects or other muscarinic reactions; but such use, by masking signs of overdosage, can lead to inadvertent induction of cholinergic crisis",
      "For detailed information on the management of patients with myasthenia gravis, the physician is referred to one of the excellent reviews such as those by Osserman and Genkins 2 , Grob 3 or Schwab 4,5 "

      "While other sources of information about the use of selegiline are available (e.g., literature reports, foreign post-marketing reports, etc.) they do not provide the kind of information necessary to estimate the incidence of adverse events",

      "Many of the adverse reactions seen have also been reported as symptoms of dopamine excess",
      "Moreover, the importance and severity of various reactions reported often cannot be ascertained",
      "One index of relative importance, however, is whether or not a reaction caused treatment discontinuation",
      "In prospective pre-marketing studies, the following events led, in decreasing order of frequency, to discontinuation of treatment with selegiline: nausea, hallucinations, confusion, depression, loss of balance, insomnia, orthostatic hypotension, increased akinetic involuntary movements, agitation, a",
      "Events reported only once as a cause of discontinuation are ankle edema, anxiety, burning lips/mouth, constipation, drowsiness/lethargy, dystonia, excess perspiration, increased freezing, gastrointestinal bleeding, hair loss, increased tremor, nervousness, weakness and weight loss",
      "Experience with selegiline obtained in parallel, placebo controlled, randomized studies provides only a limited basis for estimates of adverse reaction rates",

      "(When sodium thiosulfate is given, as described under DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , the body’s capacity for CN – elimination is greatly increased.) Methemoglobin normally present in the body can buffer a certain amount of CN–, but the capacity of this system is exhausted by the CN – produced from abou",

      "Even patients congenitally incapable of back-converting methemoglobin should demonstrate 10% methemoglobinemia only after they have received about 10 mg/kg of sodium nitroprusside, and a patient receiving sodium nitroprusside at the maximum recommended rate (10 mcg/kg/min) would take over 16 hours t",
