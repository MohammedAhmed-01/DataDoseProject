      "This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes",
      "The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups ( Diabetes , 19, supp",

      "A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality",

      "SPECIAL WARNING ON INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin",
      "This warning is based on the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes",
      "The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups",
      "UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of cardiovascular mortality approximately 2½ times that of patients treated with diet alone",
      "A significant increase in total mortality was not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for the study to show an increase in overall mortality",
      "Despite controversy regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP study provide an adequate basis for this warning",
      "The patient should be informed of the potential risks and advantages of glyburide and of alternative modes of therapy",
      "Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of action and chemical structure"

      "When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving glyburide, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia",
      "When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving glyburide, the patient should be observed closely for loss of control",
      "An increased risk of liver enzyme elevations was observed in patients receiving glyburide concomitantly with bosentan",
      "Therefore concomitant administration of glyburide tablets and bosentan is contraindicated",
      "Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of control",
      "These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, and isoniazid",

      "Intervention: Monitor patients with concomitant use of naproxen tablets or naproxen sodium tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleedin",
      "Aspirin Clinical Impact: A pharmacodynamic (PD) study has demonstrated an interaction in which lower dose naproxen (220mg/day or 220mg twice daily) interfered with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose immediate-release aspirin, with the interaction most marked during the washout period of naproxen ( ",
      "There is reason to expect that the interaction would be present with prescription doses of naproxen or with enteric-coated low-dose aspirin; however, the peak interference with aspirin function may be later than observed in the PD study due to the longer washout period",

      "These elevations were often responsive to dosage reduction",
      "More overt nephrotoxicity was seen early after transplantation and was characterized by a rapidly rising BUN and creatinine",
